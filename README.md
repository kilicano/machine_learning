# Machine Learning – MSc Econometrics & Data Analytics

This repository contains coursework from the **Machine Learning** course of the **MSc in Econometrics & Data Analytics**.

The focus of the course is on **understanding, implementing, and analysing machine learning algorithms from first principles**, with a strong emphasis on optimization, model behaviour, and empirical performance.

All work is implemented in **Python**, primarily using Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview

The projects cover core supervised learning methods, optimization techniques, and modern machine learning architectures, progressing from linear models to deep learning and ensemble methods.

Rather than treating models as black boxes, the assignments emphasize:
- objective functions
- gradients
- optimization dynamics
- bias–variance trade-offs
- interpretability and evaluation

## Topics Covered

### Linear Models & Optimization
- Linear regression implemented with **gradient descent**
- Loss functions and convergence behaviour
- Learning rate sensitivity and scaling issues

### Gradient-Based Optimizers
- Comparison of optimization methods:
  - vanilla gradient descent
  - momentum-based methods
  - adaptive optimizers
- Empirical comparison of convergence speed and stability

### Classification
- Logistic regression and classification pipelines
- Decision boundaries and performance metrics
- Overfitting and regularization effects

### Neural Networks & Deep Learning
- Feedforward neural networks from scratch
- Backpropagation and gradient flow
- Activation functions and network depth
- Introduction to deep learning concepts

### Ensemble Methods
- Bagging and boosting concepts
- Random forests and ensemble intuition
- Performance comparison against single models
